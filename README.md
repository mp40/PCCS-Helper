# Phoenix Command Combat System Assistant

This was started during my time as a student at Code Chrysalis

A React application to assist running calculations required for the Phoenix Command Combat System wargaming/roleplaying rules.

Currently, it has the following inputs:

- Characteristics, incremented via buttons
- Skill Levels, incremented via buttons
- Encumbrance, incremented via buttons

The application returns the following:

- Base Speed
- Maximum Speed
- Skill Accuracy Level
- Combat Effectiveness
- Intelligence Skill Factor
- Agility Skill Factor
- Gun Combat Actions
- Melee Combat Actions

## Install procedure

```
yarn start
```

### This is a work in progress

#### Next

- Return Knockout Value
- Return Damage Bonus
- Refactor code
- Improve UI

#### To Come

- Upgrade Encumbrance to include equipment list
- Weapon selection
